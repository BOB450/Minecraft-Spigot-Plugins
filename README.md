# Minecraft-Spigot-Plugins

A place to put my spigot plugins for minecraft. Written in java.

To use a plugin download the corresponding .jar and drop it in the plugin folder (You must be using a spigot based server os you can use paper or bukkit or whatnot)

### DM me if you want a plugin made <a herf="https://discord.com/users/277920295833305088"> Discord(BOB450)<a>
